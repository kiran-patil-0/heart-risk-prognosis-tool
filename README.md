# heart-risk-prognosis-tool
Developed and deployed a machine learning model to 
predict heart disease risk using clinical and demographic 
data, achieving high accuracy and robust performance 
through advanced feature engineering and hyperparameter 
optimization. Implemented a scalablesolution using 
Python, scikit-learn, and Flask for real-time prediction
